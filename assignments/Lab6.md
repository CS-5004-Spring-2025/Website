# Lab 6 - Fitness Tracker Design
### Due - Thursday, February 20, 4:50pm

There is no assignment link. Please add the files required below to your Project
3 repository.

<hr/>

For this assignment, you will practice using
[UML](https://github.com/CS-5004-Spring-2025/Resources?tab=readme-ov-file#uml-design-tools)
and produce a design for [Project 3](https://github.com/CS-5004-Spring-2025/Project3/blob/main/README.md).

## Requirements

You will add a file DESIGN.md to your Project3 repository. This file will
describe the design you will implement for your project. The minimum
requirements are as follows:

1. You will use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax for formatting
   DESIGN.md.
2. You will include a [UML diagram](https://github.com/CS-5004-Spring-2025/Resources?tab=readme-ov-file#uml-design-tools) that describes the classes you will implement, the
   properties of each class, and the methods each class will implement. Your
   design may change before your final submission, but your lab grade will
   depend on the completeness of your original design.
3. For each of the four requirements under the project Design Requirements, you
   will describe how you intend to integrate the requirement.
   - Describe how you will implement inheritance.
   - Describe where you will use an enum, switch, or record.
   - Describe where you will use `Comparable` or `Comparator`.
   - Describe where you will use method overriding.
