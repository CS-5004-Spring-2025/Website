# Course Description<br/>
This course explores the ideas and rationale underlying Object Oriented Design (OOD). We will use the Java programming language to exercise key concepts and best practices that support the creation of large-scale, reusable, extensible, robust software. The key concepts include:

- Information Hiding
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance (and Composition/Delegation)
- Polymorphism

The *best practices* include:

- Avoiding redundant code
- Separating information about specifications from details of implementation
- Use of Javadocs and code commentary to thoroughly document programs
- Test-driven approach to development
- Adherence to typical industry-standard style guidelines

As time permits, advanced topics will be discussed, including generics, collections, Model/View/Controller architecture, and patterns in programming. Participation in the associated recitation section, CS 5005, is required. Ideas presented in lectures are reinforced through lab assignments, which are hands-on coding tasks closely related to the topics covered in lectures. Higher-level concepts are reinforced by project assignments, which may cover material presented over 2-3 weeks.

**Course Prerequisites:** The course is suitable for students in good standing in the ALIGN MS in CS program that have successfully completed CS 5001 with a B or higher.

**Course Objectives:**

1. Design an object-oriented solution to small and moderately sized problems.
2. Implement a given object-oriented design in the Java programming language.
3. Generate appropriate documentation for developed solutions.
4. Design unit tests for a given component and implement them.
5. Explore existing documentation to describe and use existing libraries and frameworks.

# Course Resources

The class [Schedule](schedule.md) page includes links to relevant materials and
assignments. Make sure to check the schedule early and often for course updates
and information.

The Modules section of the Canvas course provides links to a library of videos
specifically produced for Align students. These are provided as a supplementary
resource for your learning. We may not cover all material that appears there.
Any material that is required by this version of the course will be explicitly
identified in class or on the class GitHub pages.

There is no required text, but the following repository includes a README resource guide that includes links to many books and other resources that will be useful: [Resources](https://github.com/CS-5004-Spring-2025/Resources)

# Announcements
Announcements and class discussion will occur on the Microsoft Team set up for the class. Join the team here: [CS 5004 - Spring 2025](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AYCGd8c06mCpPM0Vhh1QwLDxMrUZaDTLE3WjsQAXfRD41%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=56de66f9-8448-4beb-98b5-7b8d7bbf193d&tenantId=a8eec281-aaa3-4dae-ac9b-9a398b9215e7)

Students are responsible for staying current on all announcements made via the class Team. You are expected to participate in discussion on Teams. Make sure to remain professional in your communications.

# Class Workload
It is important for you to be highly engaged in this course. Like most programming courses, we are asking you to change the way you think so that you can express your thoughts to a computer. This is not an easy task.

Students are expected to keep up with the material as it is released each week, to ask for help when they need it (or when feeling overwhelmed), to complete assignments on time, to actively participate in class discussions on Teams. Students are highly encouraged to help and support each other in appropriate ways. We can also often arrange for individual tutoring in cases where there is particular need, so please let me know if you feel you need additional help staying on top of the material.

While this course is designed to for you to succeed, you will not unless you put the time in. In general, you should be prepared to spend 3-4 hours per credit hour. This means that you should plan on spending *a minimum of 12-16 hours per week on this course*.

# Assessment
- 20% Labs (weekly)
- 20% Projects (4-5)
- 25% Final Project 
- 30% Quizzes (7-10)
- 5% Interactive Grading Sessions (2)

**Labs:** Labs will be due most weeks on Monday. Students are expected to work on labs during the recitation period and complete the exercises before the deadline. Unless otherwise noted, labs are to be completed *individually*. The lowest lab grade will be dropped from the final course grade.

**Projects:** Students will be assigned projects roughly every other week.
Unless otherwise noted, projects are to be completed individually. Projects are
generally longer programs that require students to synthesize what they have
learned over the previous weeks. Each student may resubmit up to *two* projects
to earn back lost points. A project must be resubmitted within 7 days of when the project grade is
posted. A resubmission must be accompanied by a
reflection submitted via the [Project Resubmission Google
Form](https://forms.gle/V2fPgEBpjhdxVEgb8). The highest score will be kept
provided the reflection submitted is thorough and thoughtful.

**Final Project:** A comprehensive final project will be due during finals week
in lieu of a final exam. The final project will have multiple subparts due in
the weeks prior to the end of the term. No part of the final project may be
resubmitted. All grades are final.

**Quizzes:** There will be seven to ten randomized knowledge checks throughout
the semester. The first attempt at a quiz must be completed during the class or
recitation period when it is assigned. Quizzes may be repeated one time, and repeated quizzes may be taken at any time in the 48 hours
following the first attempt. A second attempt must be accompanied by a
reflection submitted via the [Quiz Resubmission Google
Form](https://forms.gle/za22nAzQbb7DaR1A6). The highest score will be kept
provided the reflection submitted is thorough and thoughtful.

**Interactive Grading Session:** Students are required to complete at least two
interactive grading sessions with the instructor for projects excluding the
final project. At least one of the sessions
must occur during the second half of the semester. During each session, the
student will demonstrate their project solution, and the instructor will ask
questions about the solution and design. The grade will be based upon the
students' explanation of their solutions and ability to answer questions about
their code and approach. 

**Grading Scale:**

| A | B | C | F | 
| :- | :- | :- | :- | 
|(A)  93.00â€“100.00 <br/>(A-) 90.00â€“92.99 |(B+) 86.00â€“89.99<br/>(B)  83.00â€“85.99<br/>(B-) 80.00â€“82.99 |(C+) 76.00â€“79.99<br/>(C)  73.00â€“75.99<br/>(C-)  70.00â€“72.99|(F)  0.00â€“69.99|  

# Policies
**Seeking Help:** In any course, all students experience some difficulties and frustration and everyone (professor included) makes mistakes. Everybody needs help sometimes, and I would love to provide it! When it is your turn to have problems, do not suffer in silence! Talk to your professor immediately, before things become serious. You can do this via Teams, email, or Zoom. She wants to help you solve these problems and does not make any judgments. Because she cannot always know when trouble starts, you must take the initiative of making initial contact.

**Code Review:** Any student may be asked to come in for code review for any assignment. A student who does not meet with the instructor for a code review in a timely manner will be given a non-droppable 0 on the assignment in question. This means that for a lab assignment, the 0 may not be dropped as the lowest lab grade. A student who is unable to explain their code; answer the instructor's questions about their code; or reproduce their code as expected may receive a deduction of up to 100%, resulting in a 0 on the assignment.

**Late Policy:** 

Late labs will not be accepted. The lowest score from one lab assignment will
be dropped from the final grade.

Late projects will not be accepted; however, up to two projects may be
resubmitted according to the guidelines described above. Resubmissions will not
be accepted beyond seven days past the time when the original grade is posted.

Late quizzes will not be accepted; however, quizzes may be retaken for up to 48
hours according to the guidelines described above. 

All deadlines related to the final project are hard deadlines. No late
submissions will be accepted.

Further exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of a verifiable medical or family emergency. Extensions and makeup exams must be arranged PRIOR to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).

Students who have legitimate, personal circumstances that warrant special consideration should speak with the instructor as early as possible to arrange for appropriate flexibility. *Job assessments and interviews are not a legitimate reason for additional flexibility.*

**Citations:** Everybody is aware of vast amount of knowledge that is available on the Internet. As a student, your job is to be honest and forthright with your efforts. It is of utmost importance to your learning that you never just cut-and-paste a solution to a homework problem; instead make the effort to understand the solution well enough to put it into your own words and be sure to cite your sources. Citations should include references (paper, website, or other) for any site that you used to research a solution. If you find yourself spending any significant amount of time searching the web, you should come and see me because it is a sign that something is not working for you in this class.

**Academic Honesty:** You are expected to read, understand, and follow the Universityâ€™s policies on Academic Integrity. Each student is expected to do his or her own work. Violations of academic integrity will result in a zero on the corresponding assignment along with harsher penalties for more widespread problems. All instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution](https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/). Here are a few examples of academic dishonesty:

- Using Chat GPT to generate all or part of your solution unless explicitly allowed for the assignment.
- Giving your code to another student.
- Submitting code written by anyone other than yourself as your own.
- Copying text from the web.
- Discussing implementation details of a solution with another student.
- Discussing code-specific details of a solution with another student.
- Soliciting help on websites such as Stack Overflow.
- General discussions with another students are okay but should be done away from the computer leaving only memories.

**Students With Disabilities:** 

> Northeastern University and Disability Access Services are committed to providing disability services that enable students who qualify under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act to participate fully in the activities of the university. 

If you require accommodations we will work with [Disability Access Services](https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu/) to ensure you have an equitable learning environment.
