## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

We do not have a required IDE for this class. Two recommended ones are IntelliJ and VS Code. Make sure to restart your computer after installing them, as they modify your path and environment variables.

Different professors lean towards different IDEs. Sami will use VS code in class, and the starter code repositories will be set up to import into VS Code.

### Recommended - Visual Studio Code (VS code)

VS Code is a popular choice for Java development. It is a lightweight IDE that is easy to use and has many features that make it a great choice. Where IntelliJ IDEA focuses on a contained environment, VS Code focuses on module extensions for everything it does. As such, you will find there are more extensions. Due to this module based design along with it being completely free, VS Code has gained in popularity over the years. 

To install Visual Studio Code, go to [VS Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the version for your operating system. You can also install it from the Microsoft Store if you are on Windows.

#### Extensions
Here are some extensions for VS Code if you are using it for Java development:

* [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) 
* [Gradle For Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle)
* [Mermaid Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)
* [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)
* [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
* [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

To find where to install extensions in VS Code, go to the extensions tab on the left side of the screen and search for the extension you want to install.

### IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE (integrated development environment) for Java development. It has many features that make it a great choice for Java development. However, it is also a very large development environment and can be overwhelming at first. For this class, we are not requiring *which* IDE you use, but we do require that you use an IDE that supports Java development. 

To install IntelliJ IDEA, while there is a community edition which is fine, you can also install the "Ultimate" edition using your student email  to setup a free license. To earn a free license go to [JetBrains Student License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) and follow the instructions. Make sure to use your student email.

You can then download the ultimate edition from [JetBrains Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), and register it with your student account. 

It is also a popular choice to use [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) to manage your IDEs. If you use the toolbox, it is better to install the ultimate edition from the toolbox, as then it will be managed by the toolbox. 


#### Plugins
Here are some plugins for IntelliJ IDEA if you are using it for Java development:

* [IntelliJ Mermaid Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20146-mermaid)
* [Markdown Plugin IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7793-markdown) 

To find where to install plugins in IntelliJ IDEA, go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins` and search for the plugin you want to install. 


## Markdown Resources

We will use markdown for our reports in this class. Here are some resources to help you get started with markdown. Mermaid is a useful tool for creating diagrams in markdown.

* [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Github Markdown Getting Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
* [Mermaid Syntax Reference](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html) 


## Git and Github
You will be using Github classroom, which requires a github.com account (not to be confused with Khoury College's Github Enterprise account). You will need to know how to use git to submit your assignments. Here are some resources to help you get started with git. For the most part, you are welcome (and encouraged) to use the built-in IDE features for git, but it is good to know how to use the command line as well.


* [Git Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics/use-git-version-control-software-to-manage-project-code) - a LinkedIn Learning guide
* [Github Basics](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), a guide for learning GitHub
* [Using Github with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git) - A guide on how to use Github with VS Code
* [IntelliJ Github Documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/github.html) - A guide on how to use Github with IntelliJ IDEA
* [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - A guide on how to write commit messages that are both human and machine readable. 


### More Advanced Git Resources
* [Head First Git](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-git/9781492092506/), book: Available on O'Reilly
* [MIT's Missing Semester of your CS Education lecture and text explainer on git](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)
* [Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) is useful for learners who want to know what is going on behind the scenes


As a reminder, git is installed by default on many Mac and Linux systems, but on windows you may need to install it. You can find the download for git at [Git Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Gradle

We will use gradle for our build system for the course. By default if you install IntelliJ IDEA, it will come with gradle. If you are using VS Code, you may need to install it separately. It is important to have VS Code Gradle extension installed if you are using VS Code.

For the most part you will not need to edit any gradle files. You just need it installed to run the tests.

* [Gradle Official Site](https://gradle.org/) 
* [Gradle User Guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html)

## UML Design Tools

* [Mermaid Class Diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/classDiagram.html) - The recommended tool for this class. All our examples will be in mermaid. 
* [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) - A free online tool for creating diagrams, though very expansive and can be overwhelming.
* [Violet UML Editor](http://alexdp.free.fr/violetumleditor/page.php) - A free UML editor that is a bit more lightweight than draw.io.
* [UMlet](https://www.umlet.com/) - Another free UML editor that is lightweight.


## CoPilot

You are may use Copilot **for syntax help**. You will find if you give too much to copilot it will break the design patterns you are trying to learn. Before you use copilot, we encourage you to follow this online guide. 

* [GitHub Copilot Fundamentals - Understand the AI pair programmer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/copilot/)
* [Responsible AI with Github Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/responsible-ai-with-github-copilot/) - important!

This only works if you really understand what is being generated. However, it can be a benefit for rote actions such as setting up your tests.
